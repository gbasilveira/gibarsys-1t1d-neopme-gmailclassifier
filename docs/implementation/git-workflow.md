# Git Workflow & Standards

[‚Üê Back to Main README](../../README.md) | [‚Üê Back to Implementation](coding-standards.md)

## Overview

This document defines Git workflow, commit standards, and pull request procedures for the Gmail Graph-Classifier Add-on project.

## Branch Strategy

### Branch Naming
- **Feature branches**: `feature/component-name` or `feature/feature-description`
- **Bug fixes**: `fix/issue-description` or `fix/component-bug`
- **Documentation**: `docs/section-update` or `docs/new-documentation`
- **Refactoring**: `refactor/component-name` or `refactor/architecture-update`

### Branch Workflow
1. Create feature branch from `main`
2. Implement changes with tests and documentation
3. Commit following standards below
4. Create pull request with detailed description
5. Code review and approval required
6. Merge to `main` after approval

## Commit Standards

### Commit Message Format

#### Bug Fix
```
fix(classification): resolve rule evaluation priority issue

Fix bug where lower-priority rules were overriding higher-priority matches:
- Correct sorting logic in RuleEvaluationService.evaluateRules()
- Add comprehensive test coverage for priority scenarios
- Update rule evaluation algorithm documentation

Breaking changes: None
Performance impact: ~5ms improvement in evaluation time

Updated tests:
- RuleEvaluationService.test.ts - added priority test cases
- Added integration tests for complex rule scenarios

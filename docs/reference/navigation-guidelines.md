# Navigation Guidelines

[← Back to Main README](../../README.md)

## Overview

This document establishes documentation navigation and cross-reference standards for optimal NLP tool navigation.

## Navigation Standards

### Navigation Links
- **Up Navigation**: Every document must include "← Back to Main README" link
- **Section Navigation**: Related documents within sections include back links to section parent
- **Cross-References**: Related documentation includes "See also" links to relevant sections

### Link Patterns
- Main README: `[← Back to Main README](../../README.md)`
- Section Parent: `[← Back to Section](parent-document.md)`
- Cross-Reference: `[Related Topic](../section/document.md)`

## Cross-Reference Guidelines

### Bidirectional References
- Documents must reference related content in both directions
- Architecture documents reference design and implementation
- Design documents reference architecture and implementation
- Implementation documents reference architecture and design

### Related Documentation Sections
- Each document includes "Related Documentation" section
- Lists 2-4 most relevant related documents
- Uses descriptive link text indicating relationship

### Code-to-Documentation References
- Source code files include documentation references in headers
- Documentation files reference relevant source code locations
- Maintain bidirectional traceability between code and docs

## NLP Optimization

### Structure Requirements
- Clear hierarchical organization for AI navigation
- Consistent formatting and section structure
- Descriptive headings and subheadings
- Comprehensive cross-linking for context building

### Content Guidelines
- Technical precision for accurate NLP interpretation
- Consistent terminology and vocabulary
- Clear separation of concerns between documents
- Minimal redundancy while maintaining context

## Implementation Standards

*Detailed navigation implementation guidelines and automation tools will be defined during development.*
